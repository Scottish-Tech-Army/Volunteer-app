# Welcome

Welcome to the the Volunteering App Github repo

# Download the app!

Get the test version of the app on your own phone so you can see it working in practice.

## iOS

Ask Joanna on Slack to set you up, you'll get an email invitation to download TestFlight and install the app from there.

## Android

Ask the team on Slack - one of the dev team needs to go to [the Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) > Volunteer app > Release > Testing > Internal testing, then they'll add your email address to the 'STA Volunteer App' Testers group (NB this must be the email address you use for the Google Play account on your phone).  Once that's done, you go to [this page](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4701609055165574724) and follow instructions to download the app.

# Requirements to run the project:

1. Node.js LTS release
2. npm
   >npm usually is installed when Node.js is installed. type npm --version to check if it is installed after installing Node.js in Command Terminal 
3. Ensure that you have read through for your particular platform: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
4. Make sure that you have Android 10 installed and not higher.

# Setup and first run

1. Ensure that you've gone through the following link for your particular platform: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

2. Pull the code from Git

3. Open Command terminal

4. Go to the `api` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **\Volunteer-app path\api**)

5. Copy the `.env.example` file in the api root folder and name your new file `.env` in the same folder. Fill in the empty values (`""`) in your file for any credentials/settings (API keys for STA Jira API access, AirTable, etc).
    >**Note** Credentials themselves not provided, these should be requested/provided on joining the dev group.

6. At the command prompt type `npm install` then `npm start` to start the Volunteer App API server.

7. Go to the `app` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **\Volunteer-app path\app**)

8. At the command prompt type `npm install`
    >**Note:** Inside the `app` folder there is package-lock.json. Everytime this is modified, it is advised to repeat step 6 before  running the project.

    >**Note:** you may need to run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

9. If you are on a Mac, go to the `app/ios` folder in a terminal window. At the command prompt type `pod install`

10. Duplicate the example config file `app/src/Config/index.example.ts` and name your new file `app/src/Config/index.ts`
    >**Note** If the app has difficulty connecting to the API, you may need specify your IP address in `index.ts`. Replace `localhost` in the line `STA_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3000'` with your own.

11. type in command terminal: `npm run ios` or `npm run android`

# Subsequent run

1. Open Command terminal.

2. Go to the `api` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **\Volunteer-app path\api**) and enter `npm start` to start the Volunteer App API server.

3. Go to the `app` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **\Volunteer-app path\app**) and enter `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.

4. Optional: Update the cached projects/resources data from Jira *(during development, you probably only need to use this if you need the very latest data from Jira or you're actively testing the caching mechanism)*.  Open another command terminal window, go to the `api` folder inside the project.
    - If you want to manually update the cached data, enter this command: `node cache/run-projects.js`
        >During development, it's preferable to do this than to run the scheduled cron job described below.
    - If you want to automatically update the cached data regularly using a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), enter this command instead: `node cache/run-cron-jobs.js`  Leave this terminal window open as long as you want this to keep running.
        >Be careful if using this during development: if multiple developers are running this simultaneously, these could conflict if more than one person is updating the same AirTable tables at the same time.

# Setup to deploy the app

This is how you get set up ready to deploy the app to the Google Play Store (for Android) and TestFlight (for iOS) later, using [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/).

You don't need to worry about doing this section until you're through all the steps above and you've solved any headaches getting the API and the app running locally.

**If you're on a Mac** you can deploy the Android and iOS versions of the app.  

**If you're on Windows/Linux** you can only deploy the Android version of the app (you'll always need to get another team member with a Mac to deploy the iOS version).

1. Install Fastlane: [Mac instructions in the 'Installing Fastlane' section here](https://thecodingmachine.github.io/react-native-boilerplate/docs/BetaBuild/#installing-fastlane) - [Windows/Linux instructions here](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/android/setup/)

    ## Google Play Store (Android)

2. Add the `key.json` file into the `/app/android/` directory.  This file contains credentials for uploading the app to the Google Play Store.  Ask on Slack for another developer in the team to send you it.
    > Because this contains sensitive access credentials we should never commit this to GitHub as our repository is open-source, anyone can see it.

3. Create a personal upload key to digitally 'sign' the app when you send it to the Google Play Store.  Follow the instructions in the ['Generating an upload key' section of this page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android#generating-a-signing-key).  As part of doing that you'll be asked to set a password -- save this somewhere safe (e.g. [a password manager](https://www.techradar.com/uk/best/password-manager)), you'll need it in the future.  Put the `my-upload-key.keystore` file you create into the `/app/android` directory.
    > This file also should never be committed to GitHub.

## TestFlight (iOS)

# Development

## API

### Caching

#### Projects

Projects data comes originally from Jira.  We have found the Jira API can be too slow for us to fetch data from it each time a request is made to the API (partly because of the speed of Jira's API itself, partly because we may be making multiple calls and then combining the data received).

So instead we store a cached copy of projects data, in the format we use it in our API, in our own database (currently AirTable) so that we can deliver a fast response when someone calls our API.  There are scripts in the `/api/cache` directory that can be run as a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to regularly update our database from the Jira API.

Please see instructions at the end of the [Subsequent run](#subsequent-run) section above on how to run these scripts.

### Services

#### Slack

This file `/api/services/slack.js` allows you to post messages to Slack.  If you want to enable posting to a new channel that we don't already post to, you need to:

1. [Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/start/planning) with a bot user, [approved by the owner of the Slack workspace](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/222386767-Manage-app-approval-for-your-workspace#h_01EC8H3AWBYEAAN5AKBTVKPC5K).  This step has already been done, the Slack app is called ['Volunteer App'.](https://api.slack.com/apps/A03ALL3M137/general)  If you don't have access to this, another member of the team can [add you as a 'collaborator'.](https://app.slack.com/app-settings/T011F5L41NH/A03ALL3M137/collaborators)

2. [Set up a webhook](https://api.slack.com/apps/A03ALL3M137/incoming-webhooks?) for the channel you want to post to.  ([More info about Slack webhooks here.](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks))
    >**Note:** this webhook URL must remain secret (don't share it openly, don't commit it to GitHub) as it enables anyone to post to that channel

3. Add the webhook as a variable in your `/api/.env` file (and in `/api/.env.example` but without the webhook URL itself).  This variable must be named `SLACK_SECRET_WEBHOOK_` and then the name of the Slack channel, all in capitals and with hyphens replaced by underscores.
    >For example, if the Slack channel is called `my-awesome-channel`, the .env variable should be called `SLACK_SECRET_WEBHOOK_MY_AWESOME_CHANNEL`

# API deployment on AWS

June 2022:

In the volapp-dev-test account, an [Elastic Beanstalk](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-west-2#/environments) environment called Volunteerapp-env has been created (manually for now).

You can connect your app to this environment by changing STA_BASE_URL to the load balancer address in `Volunteer-app/app/src/Config/index.ts`:

`  STA_BASE_URL: 'http://volunteerapp-env.eba-ivfm2tgp.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com',`

Note - as we move this into IaC and set up some build pipelines, things like env names, app names, domain names, IP Addresses will probably change.

For support, please @ David Calder in the [volunteer-app](https://scottishtecharmy.slack.com/archives/C01SUL6K5E1) Slack channel

## Updating the app
1. Git clone Scottish-Tech-Army/Volunteer-app to your computer
2. `cd Volunteer-app/api`
3. `zip ../myapp.zip -r * .[^.]*`
4. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.
5. In [Application versions](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-west-2#/application/versions?applicationName=volunteer-app), Upload the myapp.zip that you created in step 3.
6. Now select the version label you've just created and then select Action > Deploy
7. Go to the environment dashboard and check the version label has updated and the Health is OK. If not, check the Logs (menu on the left hand side).

## Known issues
* The iOS simulator only works with the IP Address of the Load Balancer as the value of STA_BASE_URL:
   * `  STA_BASE_URL: 'http://18.134.220.155',`

# App deployment

**If you're on a Mac** you can deploy the Android and iOS versions of the app.  

**If you're on Windows/Linux** you can only deploy the Android version of the app (you'll always need to get another team member with a Mac to deploy the iOS version).

1. In the pull request for the changes you're making (e.g. a new app feature), before you submit the PR for review, update the `version` number in `app/package.json`.  Normally for minor features/fixes, just update the last part of the version number (e.g. `"1.0.24"` becomes `"1.0.25"`).

2. Update `/app/android/app/build.gradle` at the same time *(be careful here! there are other files called `build.gradle` in other similar directories)*.  About halfway down the file there are two things you need to update:

    a. `versionCode` - this must be 1 higher than the existing number, e.g. `48` becomes `49` (don't use any dots in this one), no quote marks

    b. `versionName` - make this the same as `version` in `/app/package.json`, this should be in quotes (e.g. `"1.0.24"` becomes `"1.0.25"`)

3. Add changelog notes - a quick summary (a line or two will usually do) of what this new version does.  This should be a .txt file in `/app/android/fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs` named `X.txt` where `X` is the same number you used for `versionCode` in the previous step, e.g. `/app/android/fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs/49.txt`

4. Get your pull request approved as you normally would.  When you're ready to merge your code into the `main` branch and deploy the updated app, double-check your version numbers in the previous steps are still right compared to what's in `main` (somebody else could have merged in code recently and changed the version numbers since you last checked - if you need to, update the version numbers before merging).

    ## Google Play Store (Android)

5. In `/app/src/Config/index.ts` set `STA_BASE_URL` to point to the external URL for [the API endpoint on AWS](#api-deployment-on-aws) -- not to your localhost or its IP address.

6. Go to the `/app/android` directory in a terminal window and run the command `fastlane beta`.  You'll be prompted twice at the beginning for passwords -- both are the password you created in the [Setup to deploy the app section](#setup-to-deploy-the-app) above.
    > The process can take a while (sometimes 30 minutes or more)!  If it fails, try [the troubleshooting tips here](https://thecodingmachine.github.io/react-native-boilerplate/docs/BetaBuild/#troubleshooting), see [Google Play Store known issues](#google-play-store-known-issues) below or ask for help on the team Slack channel if you can't figure it out.

7. If you have access, check in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) that the new version of the app has successfully been added (Volunteer app > Release > Internal testing) -- you should see the new version number next to 'Latest release' under 'Track summary'.

8. Download the updated version of the app to your Android phone ([see download instructions](#download-the-app) near the top of this README).  On the Google Play Store screen, there should be an 'Update' button to download the latest version of the app to your device.

    ### Google Play Store known issues

    - Near the end of the deployment process an AAB file is uploaded to the Google Play Store.  This can take some time (e.g. 20 minutes on slow internet connections).  It should be working, unless you get a `HTTPClient::SendTimeoutError: execution expired` error message in your terminal window.  If the Fastlane process fails for this reason, you may need to run it again.

    ## TestFlight (iOS)

9. In `/app/src/Config/index.ts` set `STA_BASE_URL` to point to **the IP address** for the external URL for the API endpoint on AWS, see [known issues](#known-issues) above -- not to your localhost or its IP address.
