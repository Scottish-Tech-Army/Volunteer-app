# Welcome

Welcome to the the Volunteering App Github repo

# Download the app!

Get the test version of the app on your own phone so you can see it working in practice and see new test releases when they're available.

(You can also download the production version of the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sta-volunteer-app/id1632619020) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scottishtecharmy.volunteerapp), but you can't have both test and production versions installed on the same device.)

## iOS

Ask Joanna on Slack to set you up, you'll get an email invitation to download TestFlight and install the app from there.

## Android

Ask the team on Slack - one of the dev team needs to go to [the Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) > Volunteer app > Release > Testing > Internal testing, then they'll add your email address to the 'STA Volunteer App' Testers group (NB this must be the email address you use for the Google Play account on your phone).

Once that's done, you go to [this page](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4701609055165574724) and follow instructions to download the app.

# Updating to the latest version of the app

The app is being updated regularly and while it's in private testing your phone won't automatically download the latest version. Here's what you do to get the latest version:

## iOS

If you are in the Beta test group and you have the Test Flight App installed on your phone, you should receive an email and a push notification that a new version is available. In the TestFlight app Tap the **Update** button next to the STA Volunteer App to download the new version (pull down to refresh if you don't see the new update).

You can also install previous builds if you tap on the **STA Volunteer App** > **App Information** > **Previous Builds**. Note: Test Flight builds expire after about 90 days, so you won't be able to download them if they are older.

If you're not in the Beta test group, reach out to Joanna who can add you.

## Android

On your phone, go to the Play Store page from the app itself -- long press on the icon, choose App Info, then App details in store. Then if you see an 'Update' button click that to install the latest version on your device.

Alternatively, you can go to the link in the instructions above for installing the Android app, then to the Google Play Store page it takes you to. If there's an 'Update' button there click that to install the latest version on your device.

# Requirements to run the project:

1. Node.js LTS release ([the 'ACTIVE' version here](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases/))
2. npm
   > npm usually is installed when Node.js is installed. Run the command `npm --version` to check if it is installed after installing Node.js in Command Terminal
3. npx
   > Once you have npm, run the command `npx --version` to check if npx is installed. If that doesn't work, you can install npx with the command `npm install -g npx`
4. [Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone](https://expo.dev/client) -- when you're developing the app locally, you'll use Expo Go to test the app on your phone.  As part of this you'll need to [set up an Expo account](https://expo.dev/signup) if you don't have one already.

# Code editor

You can develop on your local machine.

Or if you want, you can use a cloud-based alternative like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (this might be good if you have a very slow laptop for instance).  With a free GitHub plan you get up to 60 hours a month of development time in Codespaces (which is probably plenty to volunteer on this project!)  You can [start a codespace here](https://github.com/codespaces) -- use the Blank template.

## Visual Studio Code

If you're using Visual Studio Code for development, it's recommended that you:

- Install the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- Install the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Enable formatting on save](https://scottsauber.com/2017/06/10/prettier-format-on-save-never-worry-about-formatting-javascript-again/). Combined with ESLint and Prettier, this takes care of some code style issues such as formatting, indentation and semicolon consistency for you automatically.

# Setup and first run

1. Ensure that you've gone through the setup instructions above

2. Clone the code from GitHub:

   > Using SSH do `git clone git@github.com:Scottish-Tech-Army/Volunteer-app.git` or using https do `git clone https://github.com/Scottish-Tech-Army/Volunteer-app.git`

3. Open your terminal

## API

4. Go to the `api` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **/path/to/Volunteer-app/api**)

5. Copy the `.env.example` file in the api root folder and name your new file `.env` in the same folder -- e.g. using the command `cp .env.example .env` Fill in the empty values (`""`) in your file for any credentials/settings (API keys for STA Jira API access, AirTable, etc)

   > **For security reasons, the credentials themselves are not provided here.** Ask in the [volunteer-app](https://scottishtecharmy.slack.com/archives/C01SUL6K5E1) Slack channel when you join the dev group, and somebody will send them to you.

   > **The variable `API_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` is different to all the others -- it's personal to you.**  For this value, you should enter your own name in lowercase with only dashes in between, followed by a random string of letters and numbers.  (Your local API will be exposed externally so this makes it harder for a bot or hacker to find.)  For example if your name is Nadia Bloggs it could be: `API_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN="nadia-bloggs-abc123def456ghi789"` (But don't use the numbers and letters here or they won't be random ðŸ™‚ - make up your own)

   > **Make sure you don't have any spaces either side of `=` in your `api/.env` file** for any of the values there e.g. you should have something like `AIRTABLE_ID="abc123def456"` **not** `AIRTABLE_ID = "abc123def456"`

   > **Do not use any comments in your `api/.env` file** (it's technically possible to put comments in a .env file using the `#` character, but this causes problems for the API tunnel command we're going to use below)

6. At the command prompt run `npm install` to install dependencies

> **Note** Inside the `api` folder there are files `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Every time either of these is modified, it is advised to repeat this step before running the project.

7. Then run the command `npm start` to start the Volunteer App API server. You should see a message that says `Running scheduled cron jobs... ` and `Volunteer App API is listening on port <number> in development environment`.  Leave this terminal window open.

8. Open another terminal window and in this new window run the command `npm run tunnel-mac-linux` (if you are on a Mac or Linux) or `npm run tunnel-windows` (if you are on Windows). This 'tunnels' your local API server: makes it available externally so your app running in Expo Go can access it. You should see a message saying your `your url is: https://.............` -- this is the URL of your local API server, make a note of it as you'll need it in a minute.

   > This URL should include the value you set for `API_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` in your `api/.env` file, e.g. something like `https://nadia-bloggs-abc123def456ghi789.loca.lt`

   > **If you get an error message `export: #: bad variable name`** that's because you have a comment (a line beginning with a `#`) in your `api/.env` file. Remove the commented line and try again.

## App

9. Go to the `app` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **/path/to/Volunteer-app/app**)

10. At the command prompt type `npm install`

   > Inside the `app` folder there are files `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. **Every time either of these is modified, it is advised to repeat this step before running the project.**

   > **If you get *warnings* about installing dependencies** you probably don't worry about these

   > **If you get *errors* about installing dependencies** you may need to run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` or `npm install --force` (instead of `npm install`)

11. Copy the `.env.example` file in the api root folder and name your new file `.env` in the same folder -- e.g. using the command `cp .env.example .env` Set the value of `STA_BASE_URL` to the tunnelled URL of your local API server (the one you made a note of in step 8 above). Ask on Slack for a member of the team to send you the value to use for `EXPO_APPLICATION_SERVICES_PROJECT_ID`.

    > For security reasons, the `EXPO_APPLICATION_SERVICES_PROJECT_ID` value is not stored in this repo.

12. Run Expo using `npm start`  This will run some commands and then it show you a QR code in your terminal.

  > You may get an automatic prompt to install `@expo/ngrok` or another package -- if so, type `y` to install it.

  > If you get stuck at this stage, you might need to install `@expo/ngrok` manually, globally on your local machine: run `npm install -g @expo/ngrok` then try running `npm start` again.

13. Connect your phone:
- **iPhone:** open the camera and scan the QR code, tap on the link and it should open up the app in Expo Go
- **Android:** open the Expo Go app itself and you can scan the QR code
- You should now see your local development version of the app on your phone -- any changes you make in your code should show almost instantly on your phone.  (If you find you're not seeing changes on your phone or Expo Go loses the connection, [see tips here.](APP_DEVELOPMENT.md#expo-known-issues))

14. When you've got the app to run, make a PR to improve this README! Fix something that caused you headaches, update something that's no longer correct, or add a training resource, or add something else you think would help other people to get up and running.

15. See the [Subsequent run](#subsequent-run) section below for what to do next time you want to run the app. See the [Development](#development) section below for more info on developing the app, and how to get set up to deploy changes to the app.

# Troubleshooting

Below are some commonly encountered issues and possible ways to resolve them. If it still doesn't work, post in the [volunteer-app](https://scottishtecharmy.slack.com/archives/C01SUL6K5E1) Slack channel and someone will help you.

## The API won't run

- When I run `npm start` in the `api` folder, the server errors with code `EADDRINUSE`
  > It is likely there is an instance of a server running already. To end the old instance, in terminal put in:
  ``kill -9 `lsof -i:3000 -t` ``
  and try running the server again.

- I'm not sure if my local API is running and successfully 'tunnelling' (working via a publicly available URL)
  > In the terminal window where you ran the npm tunnel command, get the URL, then paste that URL into a web browser and add `/v1/projects` at the end -- if your local API is running and tunnelling successfully, you should see a JSON response with a list of projects. (If you don't see that, try the suggestion below, and also check the terminal window where you ran `npm start` and see if there are any error messages there.)

  > Once a week, your API tunnel will expire and you'll need to enter an IP address in order to continue using it. To check if this is the case, go to the URL of your tunnelled API and add `/v1/projects` at the end (e.g. `https://nadia-bloggs-abc123def456ghi789.loca.lt/v1/projects`) If you see a web page instead of projects data, follow the instructions on the page to enter your public IP address -- follow what it says in the *If you're the developer...* section further down the page. Then stop and restart your app in Expo.

## The app won't build

- When I run `npm install`, it fails with dependency resolution errors
  > Sometimes this happens when one or more of the project dependencies gets updated and is out of step with the others. Try running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` or `npm install --force`.

- I can't get Expo started in my terminal when I run `npm start` in the `app` directory
   > You may get an automatic prompt to install `@expo/ngrok` or another package -- if so, type `y` to install it.

  > If you get stuck at this stage, you might need to install `@expo/ngrok` manually, globally on your local machine: run `npm install -g @expo/ngrok` then try running `npm start` again.

## The app gets stuck loading projects

- The app gets stuck on the Projects screen -- projects never load
  > Make sure the API is running on your local machine, and that your **api/.env** and **app/.env** files are configured correctly (see [Setup and first run](#setup-and-first-run) above)

  > Make sure you have three terminal windows open, two running the API: one running `npm start` and one running the npm tunnel command (see above), both are needed in order for the app to be able to connect to the API

  > Check if you can see data coming through from the API.  In the terminal window where you ran the npm tunnelling command, get the URL, then paste that URL into a web browser and add `/v1/projects` at the end -- if your local API is running and tunnelling successfully, you should see a JSON response with a list of projects. (If you don't see that, try the suggestion below, and also check the terminal window where you ran `npm start` and see if there are any error messages there.)

  > Your API tunnel might have fallen asleep -- try stopping the process (press Ctrl+C) in the window where you ran the npm tunnelling command, then run that command again.

  > Once a week, your API tunnel will expire and you'll need to enter an IP address in order to continue using it. To check if this is the case, go to the URL of your tunnelled API and add `/v1/projects` at the end (e.g. `https://nadia-bloggs-abc123def456ghi789.loca.lt/v1/projects`) If you see a web page instead of projects data, follow the instructions on the page to enter your public IP address -- follow what it says in the *If you're the developer...* section further down the page. Then stop and restart your app in Expo.

## The app builds, but crashes when I run it

- The app crashes with an error that says 'Metro has encountered an error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'transformFile')'
  > Make sure you are using the LTS version of Node (currently v16); see [suggested solutions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69647332/cannot-read-properties-of-undefined-reading-transformfile-at-bundler-transfo). If you want to keep your current version of Node as well, you can use tools such as [nvm (MacOS/Linux)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to manage your Node installations.

- The app crashes with an opensslErrorStack: (error: 03000086)
  > Make sure you are using Node v16 LTS due to known conflicts on some devices between OpenSSL and Node v17+; see [suggested solutions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74726224/opensslerrorstack-error03000086digital-envelope-routinesinitialization-e).

## The app in Expo Go isn't showing my changes or has lost connection

- [See the tips here](APP_DEVELOPMENT.md#expo-known-issues)

# Subsequent run

1. In a terminal window, go to the `api` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **/path/to/Volunteer-app/api**) and enter `npm start` to start the Volunteer App API server.

2. In a second terminal window, in the `api` folder and use the npm tunnel command (`npm run tunnel-mac-linux` or `npm run tunnel-windows`) to tunnel your API server so the app in Expo Go can connect to it.

3. In a third terminal window, go to the `app` folder inside the project folder (e.g. **/path/to/Volunteer-app/app**) and enter `npm start` to run Expo

4. Connect your phone to your local development version of the app in Expo Go: 
- **iPhone:** open the camera and scan the QR code, this should open up the app in Expo Go
- **Android:** open the Expo Go app itself and you can scan the QR code
   > If you find you're not seeing changes on your phone or Expo Go loses the connection, [see tips here.](APP_DEVELOPMENT.md#expo-known-issues)

# Training resources

- [STA Vimeo Showcase - Volunteer App Training](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9205161) - recordings of STA training sessions relevant to the volunteer app
- [Learn React (official tutorial, beta version)](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn) - if you are new to working with React, this is a good place to start. (The tutorial on the non-beta site is ok but quite out of date; the beta version is mostly complete and much improved)
- [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/) - React, but for building cross-platform mobile apps
- [Express JS docs](https://expressjs.com/) - this is the framework used to build the API
- [React Native Boilerplate docs](https://thecodingmachine.github.io/react-native-boilerplate/) - the project template used to kickstart our app. The docs include lots of useful information about the project structure and what some of the dependencies are used for.
