      "description": "Articulate’s strategy map, has five pillars for our future focus and attention: • the arts and creativity as a connector between culture and care • awareness and advocacy, including care experienced children’s rights to the arts and culture • places and spaces, including digital, where the ability to flourish and thrive is cultivated • child growth and development, including physical and mental well-being being nurtured • skills and workforce development for young people, teachers, social workers and artists. At the start of the lockdown Articulate was able to quickly move into the digital sphere, maintaining contact and evolving different perspectives on our projects and services as each day went past. However, that shift has meant that, at a critical time in our organisational development, we have had to take our eye off the ball in the delivery of our new five-year strategy. Though we agreed the right ‘here and now’ strategy was to act fast and do whatever it took to stay in touch with our most vulnerable young people this has meant delaying tasks that influence how we want to develop as a national charity at the crossroads between creativity and care. The upside of the situation is that we are experiencing committed engagement, dynamic and useful relationship-building with a far greater number of enquiries and young people from further afield than pre-pandemic lockdown. New young people join us daily to keep busy, alleviate stress and anxiety and take part in purposeful, collaborative and creative activity: https://us20.campaign-archive.com/?u=79b2b162625613dc8ac5a2552&id=6e8d032183 https://us20.campaign-archive.com/?u=79b2b162625613dc8ac5a2552&id=9ba045106d Can you help us get our narrative sorted and create a medium to longer term promotional campaign for national and local authorities, educators and social workers? We have so much good news to share and need your support to make sure this moment helps us consolidate and grow. Or just help us with getting the team all set up on Microsoft and making the most of the non-profit supports from people like Google etc. Thanks ever so much.

I decided I wanted to create a database of 'downwind runs' (this is an A - B course at sea) around the UK that I could paddle over the next couple of years. I asked for routes on a few social media groups I'm in and it's snowballed into me creating this website. Still thinking it's just a personal project I didn't expect the response after putting out there. It's gone global and I'm on the back foot as I don't have experience in marketing and advertising online (ie what to charge, contracts, copyright etc). In addition I create each page for each run and also populate the map. It takes me on avg 3 hours to upload 10 runs. I had 27 to do yesterday. I love it, it's a massive learning curve on so many levels. I'm passionate about my sport and have done a lot over the last few years to grow the sport in Scotland, particularly getting women on the water. I made the GB Team in 2019 and competed at World Champs in France for the first time finishing 22. I'm no spring chicken and if I can do it anyone can. Anyway I need help with the tech, legal and marketing side of this venture.",

      "description": "I haven't checked with the powers that be about whether we could go forward with this idea so I'm just scouting out whether it would be something you'd be interested in. I work in the Emergency Department (A&E). In our resus rooms where our sickest patients go, we have boxes that contain all the equipment that we need to do emergency procedures. At the moment, we use paper checklists to stock these boxes. Because we're so busy, staff who don't routinely use the equipment are needing to stock the boxes and the wrong kit is ending up in them which isn't ideal in an emergency. An electronic web app solution would hopefully mean that we could: 1) have links to the individual items with descriptions, photos and locations to increase the speed and accuracy of stocking 2) track which individual boxes were missing items from a central point so our housekeepers know we need to order stock 3) track who's stocking the boxes so we can target education if there's recurrent mistakes in stocking 4) stop running out of copies of the paper checklists (and killing lots of trees) 5) update the checklists for all that type of box simultaneously giving us more control over versions when things need updated quickly. I've had a look online and can't find any opensource stock management type software that would fit the bill. I think the tech side would be relatively straightforward - I've drawn some diagrams and possible database structures to clarify my thinking but my HTML and PHP knowledge are a lot of versions out of date and if I tried to do it it would be ugly and clunky at best!! I think it would be useful to other areas too",
